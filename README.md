# COSC310A2

The goal of this project is to create an interactive, text-based chatbot which is capable of completing 30 turns of conversation in a realistic manner.

Our project is simulating a conversation between a pair of new friends. It will focus on the topic of "hobbies". According to user's questions, the chatbot "Mike" will gives multiple responses.

# How to compile and run
This was created and test on IntelliJ IDEA CE

At this stage, the conversation focuses on only 6 topics of hobbits:

-Reading

-Basketball

-Swimming

-Cooking

-Painting

-Movies


The chatbot "Mike" can have brief conversations with user around these topics.

```bash
Mike: Hello, I'm Mike and I'm a chatbot. Nice to meet you.
User: Do you like reading?
Mike: I love reading!
User: what do you know about reading?
Mike: Reading is a good way for us to gain knowledge and enrich our experience.
User: What is your habbit of reading?
Mike: I read for half an hour every day, which helps me develop good reading habits.
```

At this stage, the agent is not able to handle the conversation of other topics or meaningless sentences.

```bash
User: Do you like playing football?
Mike: Sorry, I haven't tried it before. Do you want to introduce it for me?
User: Football is a very interesting sport.
Mike: Cool! That's interesting!
User: jsiejele
Mike: I'm sorry I don't understand. Could we talk about something else?
```
